# Medical Q&A Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis
This project involves the development of a specialized medical question-answering (Q&A) chatbot using the MedQuAD dataset. The chatbot can answer medical queries, identify medical entities such as symptoms, diseases, and treatments, and adapt responses based on user sentiment. A simple user interface, built with Streamlit, allows users to interact with the chatbot by asking medical questions and receiving emotionally appropriate responses.
